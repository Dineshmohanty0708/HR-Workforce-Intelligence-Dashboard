# HR-Workforce-Intelligence-Dashboard
This project showcases the development of an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI. The objective was to transform raw employee data into meaningful insights that support workforce planning, performance evaluation, payroll analysis, and strategic HR decision-making.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key HR metrics, including total headcount, active and terminated employees, gender distribution, department-wise workforce allocation, salary expenditure, performance ratings, satisfaction trends, recruitment source effectiveness, and geographic employee distribution. Each visual was designed to answer specific business questions and make complex HR data easy to interpret.

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query to ensure accuracy and consistency. Custom DAX measures were created to calculate KPIs such as total employees, attrition count, department-level salary totals, and performance breakdowns. Interactive filters and slicers allow dynamic analysis across departments and other dimensions.

This project demonstrates practical experience in data modeling, DAX calculations, KPI design, and data storytelling, highlighting the ability to convert business requirements into clear and actionable insights.
